        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1994</p>
        <p><strong>My Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆ (4/5)</p>
        <p>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is definitely a movie that won’t be for everyone, the humor is pretty quirky and might not click with all viewers. 
          But after watching it, I can say it’s a genuinely entertaining film with plenty of great jokes. It really showcases Jim Carrey at his best, and you 
          can tell he had a strong influence on how his character was portrayed. The movie is a fun ride, and I’d recommend giving it a watch at least once. Plus, the 
          ending is totally unexpected and highlights something that was made normal in the modern world.
